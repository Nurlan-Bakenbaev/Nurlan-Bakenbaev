## 💫 About Me

🌐 **Junior IT System Integrator** with a strong focus on **Networks & Servers**.  
My primary interest lies in **IT infrastructure** — designing, building, and maintaining **stable, secure, and scalable systems**.

I enjoy working close to the system level:  
understanding how services communicate, how networks are structured, and how infrastructure behaves under **real-world conditions**.
